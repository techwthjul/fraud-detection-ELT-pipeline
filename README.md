# End-to-End Fraud Detection Data Pipeline

---

## 🎯 What Problem Are We Solving?

Financial institutions face the critical challenge of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time to prevent financial loss and protect customers. This project solves that problem by building a scalable, end-to-end pipeline that can ingest a high volume of transaction data, process it, apply business rules to flag suspicious activity, and present the findings on an interactive dashboard for immediate analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Data Streaming:** Python, Apache Kafka, Docker
* **Data Warehouse:** Snowflake
* **Data Transformation:** dbt (Data Build Tool)
* **BI & Visualization:** Power BI
* **Data Processing:** Databricks

---

## 📈 Real-Life Use Case

The primary use case for this pipeline is for a **Fraud Analytics Team** at a bank or financial company. Analysts would use the final Power BI dashboard to:
* Monitor a live feed of potentially fraudulent transactions as they are flagged by the system.
* Quickly investigate high-value or suspicious transactions to determine if a customer's card should be blocked.
* Analyze patterns in fraudulent activity to improve detection rules over time.

## ✅ Benefits

* **Near Real-Time Insights:** The pipeline is designed to process data with low latency, allowing analysts to react to fraud much faster than traditional daily or weekly reports.
* **Scalability:** The architecture is built on highly scalable technologies like Kafka and Snowflake, capable of handling millions of transactions.
* **Modularity & Maintainability:** By using specialized tools for each stage (Kafka for streaming, dbt for transformation), the pipeline is modular and easy to maintain. Changes to business logic in dbt don't affect the data ingestion process.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provides a clear, actionable dashboard that empowers the team to make quick, informed decisions to mitigate fraud.

## ⚙️ The Whole Pipeline Working

1.  **Data Ingestion:** A Python script simulates a real-world service by reading individual transactions from a source file and streaming them one-by-one into a **Kafka** topic.
2.  **Staging:** A second Python script, acting as a consumer, listens to the Kafka topic. As each transaction arrives, it's saved as a raw JSON file in a staging area, representing a data lake landing zone.
3.  **Loading & Warehousing:** The collection of raw JSON files is loaded into a table in a **Snowflake** data warehouse, specifically within a `RAW` schema. This serves as the single source of truth for all incoming data.
4.  **Transformation:** **dbt** connects to Snowflake and runs a series of SQL models. It reads from the `RAW` schema, cleans the data, and applies business logic (e.g., `IS_FRAUD = TRUE` or `TRANSACTION_AMOUNT > 2000`). The final, transformed data is saved into a new table, `FCT_FRAUD_ALERTS`, in a clean `ANALYTICS` schema.
5.  **Visualization:** **Power BI** connects directly to the `FCT_FRAUD_ALERTS` table in Snowflake. It queries this clean data and presents it as a series of interactive visuals (cards, tables, and charts) on a dashboard for the end-user.

## 🔭 Future Scope

* **Full Automation & Orchestration:** Integrate the pipeline with an orchestrator like **Apache Airflow** to schedule the `dbt run` commands automatically, creating a truly hands-off process.
* **Machine Learning Integration:** Use the curated data in the `ANALYTICS` schema to train a machine learning model to predict fraud with higher accuracy than simple rules. The model's predictions could then be fed back into the dashboard.
* **Advanced Data Quality:** Implement `dbt` tests to enforce data quality and consistency at each stage of the transformation, ensuring the final data is always reliable.
* **CI/CD Implementation:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automatically test and deploy any changes made to the `dbt` models, improving development speed and reliability.
